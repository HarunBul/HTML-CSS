        <h1>Tech</h1>

        <p>I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Master in Computing and Information Technology in August 2021. Since February of the same year, I have worked as an Associate Software Engineer at Savvas, an EdTech company with offices in Boston and Phoenix. During my studies, I also worked as a TA for two classes (see below).</p>

        <p>As a career changer, I'm very grateful to be in the industry that I am. It's hard to single out one thing that I love about working in tech, but if I had to sum it up, I would highlight "three C's": collaboration, creativity, and craftsmanship. I love working as part of a team with a common purpose, crafting quality code using hard-earned skills, and ultimately creating something that can make people's everyday lives better. I also just genuinely love learning and am happy to be in a field where I can always challenge myself intellectually and pick up something new.</p>
