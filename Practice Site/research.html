        <h1>Research</h1>

        <p>Prior to entering the tech industry, I pursued an academic career as a historian. I received a Ph.D. in History from Columbia University in May 2019. Since then, I have also been a Visiting Researcher at Harvard's Center for Middle Eastern
        Studies and currently have two book chapters under review for publication. My research focused on the intellectual and social history of the Balkans, and in particular on Muslim communities in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
