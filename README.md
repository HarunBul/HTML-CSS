# HTML-CSS
### My code from systematically learning HTML and CSS.

Though I have a degree in Computer Science and now work as a Software Engineer, I never sat down and systematically learned HTML and CSS, the building blocks of the web. Coursework often treated them as basic skills that anyone could pick up as they went--and I did. I've used them both at school and at work to create web apps and handle accessibility tickets. Now, I want to approach them a little more strategically and lay a stronger foundation for my work in web development. This repository will house different exercises and projects that I will undertake to that end.

I am drawing on a handful of **sources**: (1) Frontend Master's [Web Development Bootcamp](https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/); (2) Jon Duckett's "[HTML and CSS](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/)" textbook; and (3) freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/) course.
